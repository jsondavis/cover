Goal is to allow a team of users to claim shifts. The ideal setup will give the most senior crew members first call for the shifts or default to the most senior members unless they want to pass it off for tothers to pickup.  The Role portion of the app would ensure that designated roles are filled on the crew by someone who meets the minimum requirements for that role.  Later features could involve weighting based on other factors like other claimed shifts within the week, a manager or client preference.


## Reasoning behind design decisions
I started this project as a reintroduction to php for myself. I've been almost exclusively using JS or Golang as my backend language of choice for the past 4-5 years. Also I figured I'd throw together something _without_ using an LLM. I'll circle back and iterate on things if it ends up being useful as anything other than a toy app.
